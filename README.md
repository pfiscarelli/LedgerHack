# LedgerHack
A GUI-based tool for decrypting a proprietary Ledger DB on the TRS-80 Color Computer

This is a response to a challenge posted on the TRS-80 Color Computer Facebook group. The user who posted this challenge created a Ledger application on the TRS-80 Color Computer and implemented encryption to protect database entries. She had encrypted one of the databases on the disk image and issued a challenge to the community to see if someone may be able to hack her encryption and decipher the messages. This was my approach to deciphering the contents and reverse engineering the keys she used to encrypt the database.
